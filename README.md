# UFOs


## Overview of the Project

The request was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using multiple filter criteria to create a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.


## Porpuse

The purpose of this analysis is to begin the journey of learning JavaScript by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and vizualization. In this project I will assist Dana, a data journalist, as she writes an article about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. According to Dana her hometown is famous for its UFO sightings that go back to her choldhood during the 1950's. She has decided to use a Javascript data file she received to create a Webpage for her story and to make the data available to others. We will build a dynamic Webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. It will also be important to draw upon my knowledge of CSS and Boootstrap to build and style the page for consistent functionality. I'll also use ChromeDev tools to test the code created for the Webpage.

Specifically, I am going to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria. The page will display Dana's article and give those who visit her page the opportunity to interact with the data and search for UFO sightings based on defined criteria. This will be a wonderful opportunity to assist Dana in creating a useable tool for those who are interested in searching for UFO sightings that occurred throughout the United States.


## Results

We've done a lot of work and I truly hope you have enjoyed the process as much as I have. The final phase of our project, Dana, is to make sure you are comfortable using the filtering capability of the Webpage we have created. It has some limitations, but overall it is a great tool for searching the data you provided for the project.

1. First, take a look at the three pictures I have provided below. You'll see that there are five criteria proveded for the 'Filter Search': date, city, state, country, and shape. As well, there are potentially seven results for each search: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. It will be necessary for the user to match one of the five criteria provided with data in our Javascript file in order for a result to be returned.
2. Next, it is not necessary to fill in each box in order for information to be returned. You'll see in the first picture below that only the 'Enter a City' box was chosen and information on every event in our data that occurred in that city is returned in the search. The same is true for the second picture that demonstrates what will happen when only a shape is known and nothing else. The result is every event that matches the filter of 'shape' is returned from the data linked to the Webpage.
3. And finally, if someone has a specific event in mind and all five of the criteria are chosen, the results are very specific. Pretty cool, huh! I think your idea is great! Thank you for the opportunity to work with someone who knew exactly what we needed to accomplish.

### HTML Page and our results

## Summary

We have created a page that looks clean and allows the user to filter through the different sitings in our data set using the search bars created. One big drawback about our search bar is trying to validate the sitings that happened which can be better described in the data. If we had how many people were at the siting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be.

#### My two recommendations for improving this website would be:

1. To have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site
2. Adding another filter to find the sitings by lengt and last but not least have a site that would be constantly updating our data adding new sitings to our page.
