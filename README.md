# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The request was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using multiple filter criteria to create a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

## Summary

We have created a page that looks clean and allows the user to filter through the different sitings in our data set using the search bars created. One big drawback about our search bar is trying to validate the sitings that happened which can be better described in the data. If we had how many people were at the siting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be. My two recommendations for improving this website would 1. to have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site 2. adding another filter to find the sitings by lengt and last but not least have a site that would be constantly updating our data adding new sitings to our page.
